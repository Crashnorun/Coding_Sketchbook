# Lorenz Attractor 

Originally descovered by [Edward Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz), this set of simple differential equations generates what may seem to be a chaotic system mimicing a figure-8 pattern. The equations are listed below:

Below are the more popularly used variables for ρ, σ, β:
 - ρ = 28 
 - σ = 10 
 - β = 8/3
