# P5

The P5 folder contains a series of sketches that are using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. P5 references three main files

- P5.js
- P5.dom.js
- P5.sound.js

Each of the files listed above has a .min.js file which is the minified js file.

There are also two TypeScript files:

- P5.d.ts
- P5.global-mode.d.ts

 which are used for intellisense when using Visual Studio Code.
