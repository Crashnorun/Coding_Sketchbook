# Quadtree

This project is an exercise from the [Coding Train YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxEcs0w_kE). The goal of this sketch is to create a recursive sketch using P5.js. Run the index.html file and you will get a black canvas where you will be able to click and drag your mouse across the screen. As you drag your mouse you will see points appear and the quadtree will then subdivide accordingly.
