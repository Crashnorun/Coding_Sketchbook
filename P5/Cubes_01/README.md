# Cubes

This project contains a series of rotating cubes that each differ in color. This sketches experiments with manipulating the RGB values in the XYZ dimensions by controlling the material applied to each box.

- Red corresponds to the Y axis. The large the Y value, the greater the Red value
- Green corresponds to the X axis. The smaller the X value, the greater the Green value
- Blue corresponds to the Z axis. The larger the Z value, the greater the Blue value

A rotation is applied to each cube for effect.
