# Circles
These two projects look at some basic interaction between the mouse and the canvas. As that mouse pointer moves across the canvas circles are being populated on the screen. The background is constantly being refreshed with an opacity level to allow the circles to fade out. 

## Circles 01
The first project simply looks at these mouse & canvas interaction

## Circles 02
The second project looks at a constant chaning in scale between the circles. The scale change is relative to the sketch framerate.
